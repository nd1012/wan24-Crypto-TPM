<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: The code has not been tested with a real TPM running on Linux
yet. I'd appreciate if someone would give me some feedback, if it worked for
them. Anyway the tests use the Microsoft TPM simulator and did run
successfully (and also with a real TPM device on Windows 11).</p>
<p>This library contains some helpers for easy TPM(2) usage. It does <em>way not</em>
implement everything that a TPM offers - these are the selected features,
which include the TPM into your security model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine if TPM2 can be accessed</li>
<li>Determine the max. supported digest (size)</li>
<li>Random number generation (<code>TpmRng</code>)</li>
<li>HMAC-SHA-1/256/384/512 (<code>Tpm2Helper</code> and <code>MacTpmHmacSha*Algorithm</code>)</li>
<li><code>TpmSymmetricKeySuite</code> which implements <code>ISymmetricKeySuite</code></li>
<li><code>TpmSecuredValue</code> which works like <code>SecureValue</code></li>
<li><code>TpmSharedSecret</code> for usage with a remote key storage</li>
<li><code>TpmValueProtection</code> to extend <code>ValueProtection</code></li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the number of features is quiet clear.</p>
<p>This library extends the <code>wan24-Crypto</code> library with these algorithms:</p>

<p><strong>CAUTION</strong>: TPM secured information won't be usable anymore, if the TPM (or
even the TPM owner) changes!</p>
<p>The goal of this library is to make TPM usable for everyone in a simple way,
without having to fight with a firmware and complex/missing documentation.
It's an ideal extension to the existing <code>wan24-Crypto</code> infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: There are no provisioning functionaliies implemented in this
library. A TPM which is going to be used needs to be provisioned manually or
from the host OS (Windows f.e. does provision a TPM automatically).</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-it">How to get it</h2>
<p>This library is available as
<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/wan24-Crypto-TPM/">NuGet package</a>.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>In case you don't use the <code>wan24-Core</code> bootstrapper logic, you need to
initialize the TPM2 extension first, before you can use it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">wan24.Crypto.TPM.Bootstrap.Boot();
</code></pre>
<p>This will register the algorithms to the <code>wan24-Crypto</code> library.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: All algorithms will be registered, no matter if there's even a TPM
available or not, or if the algorithm is supported by an available TPM. This
is because the TPM options support configuring a simulator or to choose
between multiple available TPMs. So the bootstrapper can't really know which
algorithms are going to be available (or used).</p>
<p>In case you work with dependency injection (DI), you may want to add some
services:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">builder.Services.AddWan24CryptoTpm();
</code></pre>
<p>This will register transient <code>Tpm2Options</code> (using <code>Tpm2Helper.DefaultOptions</code>)
and <code>Tpm2</code> (using <code>Tpm2Helper.CreateEngine</code>) service objects.</p>
<h3 id="json-configuration">JSON configuration</h3>
<p>You could implement a JSON configuration file using the <code>AppConfig</code> logic from
<code>wan24-Core</code>, and the <code>TpmCryptoAppConfig</code>. There it's possible to define
disabled algorithms, which makes it possible to react to an unwanted algorithm
very fast, at any time and without having to update your app, for example. If
you use an <code>AppConfig</code>, it could look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">public class YourAppConfig : AppConfig
{
    public YourAppConfig() : base() { }

    [AppConfig(AfterBootstrap = true, Priority = 20)]
    public CryptoAppConfig? Crypto { get; set; }

    [AppConfig(AfterBootstrap = true, Priority = 10)]
    public TpmCryptoAppConfig? Tpm { get; set; }
}

await AppConfig.LoadAsync&lt;YourAppConfig&gt;();
</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: A <code>TpmCryptoAppConfig</code> should be applied before a <code>CryptoAppConfig</code>.
For this reason the example defines a priority in the <code>AppConfigAttribute</code>.</p>
<p>In the <code>config.json</code> in your app root folder:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">{
    &quot;Tpm&quot;:{
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Anyway, you could also place and load a <code>TpmCryptoAppConfig</code> in any
configuration which supports using that custom type.</p>
<h3 id="tpm2engine-fixes-multithreading-bugs"><code>Tpm2Engine</code> fixes multithreading bugs</h3>
<p>Using a <code>Tpm2</code> instance for each thread still has multithreading problems in
the MS.TSS .NET library, that's why a <code>Tpm2Engine</code> should be used in
multithreading environments. It ensures that</p>
<ul>
<li>only one <code>Tpm2</code> instance is being used at a time</li>
<li>only one thread can use the <code>Tpm2</code> instance at a time</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">// Creating a Tpm2Engine uses static thread synchronization (a Tpm2Engine instance should be singleton)
using Tpm2Engine engine = Tmp2Engine.Create();

// Using per-engine thread synchronization (optional, to use one Tpm2Engine instance from multiple threads)
using SemaphoreSyncContext ssc = engine.Sync;

// Now you can perform a TPM operation using the engine.TPM property, which hosts the Tpm2 instance
</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This is only required unless the multithreading bugs in the MS.TSS
.NET library has been fixed by its vendor. In theory it should be possible to
use a <code>Tpm2</code> instance per thread without static thread locking (while
multithreaded access to a <code>Tpm2</code> instance still requires thread
synchronization).</p>
<p>In case you're using <code>Tpm2Helper.DefaultEngine</code>, the <code>Tpm2Engine</code> usage is
slightly different:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">// Creating a Tpm2Engine uses static thread synchronization (a Tpm2Engine instance should be singleton)
using Tpm2Engine engine = new();// The empty constructor will use the Tpm2Helper.DefaultEngine and Tpm2Helper.DefaultEngineSync

// Using per-engine thread synchronization
using SemaphoreSyncContext ssc = engine.Sync;

// Now you can perform a TPM operation using the engine.TPM property, which hosts the Tpm2 instance
</code></pre>
<p>Implemented types support using a <code>Tpm2Engine</code> also, which will then not be
disposed, but used for synchronizing the TPM access.</p>
<h3 id="tpm2-options">TPM2 options</h3>
<p>In the <code>Tpm2Options</code> you can define how to connect to the TPM. You may also
specify</p>
<ul>
<li>a resource handle (currently used for finalizing a HMAC)</li>
<li>an algorithm (currently used for creating a HMAC)</li>
<li>a tagged object (which will be cloned, if it implements <code>ICloneable</code>, and
the <code>GetCopy</code> method of the <code>Tpm2Options</code> instance has been called)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the <code>With*</code> methods you can configure options fluent.</p>
<h3 id="determine-if-tpm2-can-be-accessed">Determine if TPM2 can be accessed</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">bool canAccessTpm2 = Tpm2Helper.IsAvailable();
</code></pre>
<p>Because on a Linux system some file IO operations may run, there's an
<code>IsAvailableAsync</code> method, too.</p>
<h3 id="tpm2-instance-creation"><code>Tpm2</code> instance creation</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">using Tpm2 engine = Tpm2Helper.CreateEngine();
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Tpm2</code> instance is a connected TPM2 TSS, which allows to do whatever the
TSS offers. By giving <code>Tpm2Options</code> to the <code>CreateEngine</code> method, you can
define which TPM to use, and optional set an <code>Initializer</code> delegate, which may
bring the TPM into the desired state, before running any other operation.</p>
<p>The <code>CreateEngine</code> method is being called internal, whenever you use a TPM
functionality without giving an existing <code>Tpm2</code> instance to the called method.
And if you didn't specify the <code>Tpm2Options</code>, the <code>Tpm2Helper.DefaultOptions</code>
will be used, which you may preset, if required.</p>
<p>The <code>TryCreateEngine</code> does the same as <code>CreateEngine</code>, but won't throw on
error.</p>
<h3 id="maximum-supported-digest-size">Maximum supported digest (size)</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">int maxDigestSize = Tpm2Helper.GetMaxDigestSize();// Size in byte
TpmAlgId maxDigest = Tpm2Helper.GetDigestAlgorithm(maxDigestSize);
</code></pre>
<p>The max. supported digest size limits the output of the random number
generator, and it also defines the possible digest algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <code>TpmRng</code> doesn't limit the random number count being generated in
any way.</p>
<h3 id="random-number-generator">Random number generator</h3>
<p><strong>CAUTION</strong>: The example code is actually a negative example - see &quot;Best
practices&quot; for a better solution suggestion!</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">RND.Generator = new TpmRng();// If not used as singleton, an instance should be disposed!
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>TpmRng</code> implements the <code>IRng</code> interface, which allows to use the TPM as
RNG for <code>wan24-Crypto</code>. Internal it uses the <code>Tpm2Helper.CreateRandomData</code>
helper method, which is restricted to the TPMs random number output length,
while the RNG implementation doesn't restrict the length of the generated
random data.</p>
<h3 id="hmac-sha-1256384512">HMAC-SHA-1/256/384/512</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">byte[] hmac = Tpm2Helper.Hmac(anyAuthMessage);
</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The owner resource handle will be used per default.</p>
<p>Using the <code>Tpm2Helper.Hmac</code> method you can create a HMAC-SHA-1/256/384/512
using the TPM. These HMACs can only be re-created using the same TPM.
Specifying an additional MAC key is optional.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Not every TPM implements all algorithms. HMAC-SHA-256 seems to be
implemented by most TPMs. If you don't specify an algorithm to the <code>Hmac</code>
method, it'll determine and use the maximum supported algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>CAUTION</strong>: If you change your TPM hardware, you won't be able to re-create a
HMAC! This also applies even only the TPM owner changes.</p>
<p>You can also use the <code>wan24-Crypto</code> registered HMAC algorithms during
encryption, for example. Then cipher data couldn't be decrypted on any other
computer than the one that encrypted it.</p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: If you use a TPM HMAC of your encryption password, you can ensure
that the cipher data can only be decrypted from the same computer that was
used to encrypt it!</p>
<p>There are also <code>TpmHmac*</code> extension methods for a <code>byte[]</code> and
<code>(ReadOnly)Span&lt;byte&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="tpm-symmetric-key-suite">TPM symmetric key suite</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">using TpmSymmetricKeySuite tpmAuth = new(key);
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>TpmSymmetricKeySuite</code> works as the <code>SymmetricKeySuite</code>, but uses a TPM
HMAC for calculating the final key (and identifier, if any).</p>
<h3 id="tpm-secured-value">TPM secured value</h3>
<p>The <code>TpmSecuredValue</code> works as <code>SecureValue</code> and protects a value using the
TPM.</p>
<p>If you'd like TPM only if available, you can set the constructor parameter
value of <code>requireTpm</code> to <code>false</code>. If TPM is not available, the constructor
won't throw, and <code>TpmSecuredValue</code> will just work as <code>SecureValue</code> as a
fallback solution.</p>
<h3 id="en-decrypting-a-private-key-suite">En-/decrypting a private key suite</h3>
<p>Using the <code>TpmEncrypt</code> extension method you can encrypt a <code>PrivateKeySuite</code>
using a TPM flavored key. With <code>Tpm2Helper.DecryptPrivateKeySuite</code> you can
decrypt it.</p>
<p><strong>CAUTION</strong>: If you change your TPM hardware, there's no way to decrypt the
private key suite anymore! The cipher data can only be decrypted using the
same TPM hardware that was used for encryption. This also applies even only
the TPM owner changes.</p>
<h3 id="en-decrypting-a-key-ring">En-/decrypting a key ring</h3>
<p>Using the <code>TpmEncrypt</code> extension method you can encrypt a <code>KeyRing</code> using a
TPM flavored key. With <code>Tpm2Helper.DecryptKeyRing</code> you can decrypt it.</p>
<p><strong>CAUTION</strong>: If you change your TPM hardware, there's no way to decrypt the
key ring anymore! The cipher data can only be decrypted using the same TPM
hardware that was used for encryption. This also applies even only the TPM
owner changes.</p>
<h3 id="tpm-shared-secret">TPM shared secret</h3>
<p>The <code>TpmSharedSecret</code> is a helper for deriving a TPM secured key from a remote
key storage.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The following examples assume that your remote key storage requires
sending a secret for receiving a secret. This may be different per each remote
key storage.</p>
<p>Example how to initialize a new secret:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">using Tpm2 engine = Tpm2Helper.CreateEngine();
byte[] token = RND.GetBytes(Tpm2Helper.GetMaxDigestLength(engine)),
	remoteSecret = RND.GetBytes(token.Length);
// Store the token somewhere for restoring the secret later
using TpmSharedSecret tpmSecret = new(token, engine: engine);
tpmSecret.ProtectRemoteSecret(remoteSecret);
// Send tpmSecret.Secret.Array and remoteSecret to the remote key storage
byte[] secret = tpmSecret + remoteSecret;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>CAUTION</strong>: <strong><em>NEVER</em></strong> store <code>remoteSecret</code> persistent outside of the remote
key storage! <strong><em>NEVER</em></strong> store <code>tpmSecret.Secret.Array</code> anywhere!</p>
<p><code>tpmSecret.Secret.Array</code> is used to authenticate for receiving the value of
<code>remoteSecret</code> from the remote key storage later.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <code>token</code> may be stored plain, maybe protected using the OS
capabilities (like the file system ACL, f.e.).</p>
<p>Example how to restore a previously initialized secret:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">// Load the token from where it was saved during secret initialization
using TpmSharedSecret tpmSecret = new(token);
// Send tpmSecret.Secret.Array to the remote key storage and receive remoteSecret
byte[] secret = tpmSecret + remoteSecret;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>TpmSharedSecret</code> also supports including an additional secret (for user
authentication f.e.).</p>
<h3 id="tpm-value-protection">TPM value protection</h3>
<p>The <code>TpmValueProtection</code> uses the TPM for protecting a value as
<code>ValueProtection</code> does without the TPM. For this the scope keys will be used
as value for a TPM HMAC, which will then be the final key being used for the
value encryption (the max. TPM supported HMAC algorithm will be used).</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The <code>TpmValueProtection</code> uses the scope keys from <code>ValueProtection</code>
and uses the default TPM state for creating the HMAC. That means in particular
you'll still have to ensure a restorable user scope key, while you don't have
to take care the system scope key anymore.</p>
<p>You may replace the <code>ValueProtection</code> protect/unprotect handlers:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">TpmValueProtection.Enable();
</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The <code>TpmValueProtection</code> protect/unprotect handlers will connect to
the TPM for every call, which is an overhead and may impact the performance of
your application. If you don't want that, you may simply replace the
<code>ValueProtection</code> user/system scope keys with TPM HMACs, probably including an
user secret for the user scope key.</p>
<p>Or you can use both, the <code>ValueProtection</code> and the <code>TpmValueProtection</code>, as it
is suitable for your application, separately.</p>
<h3 id="extension-methods">Extension methods</h3>
<p>The <code>TpmExtensions</code> class exports some extension methods to make life more
easy, when working with TPM types and <code>wan24-Crypto</code>. There are also
extensions for the <code>PrivateKeySuite</code>, <code>byte[]</code> and <code>(ReadOnly)Span&lt;byte&gt;</code>
(TPM HMAC creation). Using the <code>CryptoOptions.WithTpmHmac</code> extension method,
you can set the max. supported TPM HMAC algorithm for any crypto application
which requires to compute a MAC.</p>
<h3 id="using-a-singleton-tpm2-connection">Using a singleton TPM2 connection</h3>
<p>By setting a <code>Tpm2</code>  instance to the <code>Tpm2Helper.DefaultEngine</code> property, you
can specify a singleton connection to use from <code>Tpm2Helper</code> methods. Use the
<code>Tmp2Helper.DefaultEngineSync</code> to synchronize multithreaded connection usage:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">// Set a singleton default TPM engine
Tpm2Helper.DefaultEngine = Tpm2Helper.CreateEngine();

// Synchronize the default TPM engine access before performing any Tpm2Helper operation
using SemaphoreSyncContext ssc = Tpm2Helper.DefaultEngineSync;
// Now you can perform any Tpm2Helper operation in a multithreaded environment using the singleton Tpm2Helper.DefaultEngine
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Tpm2Helper.DefaultEngine</code> value will be set to the <code>engine</code> parameter of
<code>Tpm2Helper</code> methods, if no value was given.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-support-tpm-pkisigningsealingetc">Why not support TPM PKI/signing/sealing/etc.?</h2>
<p>If you followed the TPM development process until today you know that TPM2 is
fully incompatible with TPM1. I try to concentrate on the absolute minimum
that TPM offers, to stay (hopefully) compatible with TPM3 (or any future TPM
version). With the HMAC function you should have everything that is required
at minimum, for implementing everything else using <code>wan24-Crypto</code> (which
offers way more functionality than TPM does). The <code>ExpandedKey</code> of a
<code>TpmSymmetricKeySuite</code> can be used for any encryption, and it's bound to the
available TPM, so you could encrypt a <code>PrivateKeySuite</code>, for example, which
can then only be decrypted using the same TPM. And you're not bound to the TPM
implemented algorithms, as you have the free choice to use any <code>wan24-Crypto</code>
implemented cryptographic algorithm, and optional combine them with the
provided TPM functionality.</p>
<p>To sum it up - the reasons for <em>not</em> using all of the TPM capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>TPM doesn't implement the cryptographic algorithms that you need to use</li>
<li>The TPM processing speed is decreased because of KDF usage in places where
you don't want (need) to use KDF (at all)</li>
<li>Future security developments require new TPM hardware, which will mess up
your PKI</li>
<li><em>TPM is way not the answer</em> to all crypto related questions</li>
<li>TPMx may fully break TPM2 key capabilities (again), while the implemented
features of <code>wan24-Crypto-TPM</code> <em>may</em> still be supported ('cause they're the
absolute basics, which should be valid for at last the next decade from now)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many good reasons to use only the absolute basics of the offered TPM
features, and only a few applications which are really enriched by the TPM,
which is usually being used in normal devices.</p>
<p>Someone might argue that TPM can encrypt/decrypt (seal/unseal) data
independent from the OS and other hardware - yes, that's true. If AES-128 does
still fit your security policy in 2023+, you'd be fine with it (use <code>Tpm2</code>).
But remember that the in-TPM en-/decryption is only suitable for small blobs!
This in combination limits the application in a way which is not acceptable
for the most use cases for cryptography: If you want to process larger blobs,
you have to DIY. If you need AES-256 (or any other algorithm than the TPM
implemented ones), you have to DIY. Instead of using the TPM lockout, DIY and
use KDF in addition. That's enough DIY to skip implementing support for the
TPM offered functionality into <code>wan24-Crypto-TPM</code> and sticking to the TPMs
HMAC only, which is enough already (and not to forget the RNG also). Brute
Force will always stay possible, no matter if you use TPM or not - remember
that.</p>
<p>However, if you need all the TPM functionality (if your boss or a customer is
obsessed with TPM and no technical argument seems to count anymore - I know
something like that...), you're free to use <code>Tpm2Helper.CreateEngine</code> and work
with the <code>Tpm2</code> object directly and without any limit.</p>
<p>From my sight there's only one reason for sticking to the TPM implemented
functionality: Private keys will be used for crypto/signature witin the TPM
only, which allows protecting/authenticating sensitive information within an
isolated processor, which runs independent from the rest of the system. But
since the rest of the system controls the TPM, it's nothing more than a piece
of hardware which can be used to identify a device. Remember that there's
still software (the TSS and the firmware), which is required to be
implemented, and is a point of failure for the TPM offered security stack.
Once that software was attacked with success, your software has been broken,
too. So even the identification of a device using TPM isn't 100% trustable.</p>
<h2 id="supported-platforms">Supported platforms</h2>
<p>All platforms which support TPM should be supported by this library. Anyway,
Apple devices often don't contain a TPM, but a T2 (which is similar to TPM)
instead (which may be called T8012, too).</p>
<p>I've successfully run the tests on a Windows 11 computer only so far, since at
the moment I don't own a Linux device with a TPM. But Linux supports TPM, and
the underlaying TSS.MSR .NET library supports Linux, finally.</p>
<p>So the supported platform list may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows (10+)</li>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>(MAC OSX)</li>
</ul>
<p>There seems to be no .NET library for Apples T2 chip, and I'm not going to
implement one. You could use the MAC OSX API for the T2 chip directly by using
interop, but however, since HMAC seems not to be supported, I'd use a T2 as a
better HWRNG only.</p>
<p>For Apple iOS (and others != OSX) there is a &quot;Security Enclave&quot;, which is a
SoC like TPM - but also without HMAC support, so it can be seen as a better
HWRNG, too.</p>
<p>On an Android device you'd use the KeyChain or TEE API usually, but there
could also be a TPM being supported. However, it's not supported by the
TSS.MSR, so this library can't offer support, too.</p>
<p>To sum it up: Forget about Apple and Android, and concentrate on Windows and
Linux, if you'd like to use this TPM library.</p>
<h2 id="best-practice">Best practice</h2>
<h3 id="tpmrng-usage"><code>TpmRng</code> usage</h3>
<p>Random numbers are security critical, and it may be a bad idea to rely on one
entropy source or RNG only. For this I suggest to use the <code>TpmRng</code> together
with other RNGs, and combine their generated random numbers using a <code>XorRng</code>.</p>
<h3 id="tpm-encrypted-privatekeysuite">TPM encrypted <code>PrivateKeySuite</code></h3>
<p>When your app requires a TPM protected private key suite, you can create one
with these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a <code>PrivateKeySuite</code></li>
<li>Encrypt the <code>PrivateKeySuite</code> using the <code>TpmEncrypt</code> extension method</li>
<li>Store the cipher data in a file</li>
<li>Dispose the <code>PrivateKeySuite</code> when not in use anymore!</li>
</ol>
<p>To load it when your app starts again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decrypt the <code>PrivateKeySuite</code> cipher data from the file using
<code>Tpm2Helper.DecryptPrivateKeySuite</code></li>
<li>Dispose the <code>PrivateKeySuite</code> when not in use anymore!</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="persistent-secret-storage">Persistent secret storage</h3>
<p>Different OS offer different secret storage solutions - but none of them seem
to offer a real security benefit. There's only one thing, which could enhance
security (really): Storing a part of a secret at another system.</p>
<p>To make this process combinable with TPM, there's the <code>TpmSharedSecret</code>
helper class, which makes it possible to restore an (user) secret using a TPM
bound token, which may be stored in plain on the processing system, but
requires using a remote key storage to provide a partial key for a TPM
processed token value, which acts as a shared secret.</p>
<p>When storing a mashine scope secret, it ensures that</p>
<ul>
<li>the ciphered data on that mashine can be remote-deleted by simply deleting
the remote stored secret</li>
<li>someone which could access any key part (or both), but isn't able to access
the TPM, can't get to the final key</li>
</ul>
<p>When storing an user scope secret, it ensures in addition that</p>
<ul>
<li>even when having both key parts and access to the TPM, a dictionary or Brute
Force attack on the user password isn't practicable, when the user password is
secure (has been KDF processed)</li>
</ul>
<p>These benefits apply to both sides: The local system, and the remote key
storage. By the way the remote key storage should store the provided secret
encrypted using the shared secret, and never store the shared secret anywhere.</p>
<p>To get a final key</p>
<ul>
<li>the plain stored token must be available (1st part of the key)</li>
<li>access to the TPM must be available (for computing the shared secret)</li>
<li>the remote storage must reply the 2nd part of the key for the provided
shared secret</li>
<li>another TPM access must be possible to combine both key parts</li>
</ul>
<p>An attacker can't use the plain stored token (1st key part) alone. He even
can't request the 2nd key part from the remote key storage, if the TPM can't
be accessed. Also the 2nd key part alone doesn't offer any success for an
attacker, if the TPM can't be accessed, too - and even when having both key
parts, the TPM access is a required component to get to the final key. To
break the security, an attacker requires both key parts and having access to
the TPM. This applies to a mashine scope secret.</p>
<p>For an user scope secret, an attacker would then still need the user password.
To secure the user password, you should pre-process it using KDF before you
use it as the <code>key</code> parameter in the <code>TpmSharedSecret</code> constructor. This I'd
call an almost perfect solution in 2023 then.</p>
<p>Anyway, there are some pitfalls with that solution: IF</p>
<ul>
<li>the TPM (owner) changed, or the TPM is broken, then ciphered data is lost</li>
<li>there is no connection to the remote key storage possible, ciphered data
can't be accessed unless the connection problem was solved</li>
<li>the remote stored key part got lost, then ciphered data is lost, too</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to have that in mind and implement emergency solutions for such
(worst case) scenarios to avoid a data loss.</p>
